🕰️ Deathly Cloak (Python + OpenCV)

Bring magic to your screen with the Deathly Cloak! This project creates a Harry Potter-style invisibility cloak using Python and OpenCV. Wear a red cloak, and watch yourself disappear as the background takes over — just like invisibility magic! 🪄✨
🚀 How It Works

Capture the background image (without you in the frame).

Detect the red color cloak in the live video using HSV color space.

Replace the red cloak area with the saved background.

Display the final output → you look invisible 🎥✨
